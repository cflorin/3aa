# V1 Implementation Log

## Purpose
This log tracks all implementation actions taken during V1 build. It is append-only in spirit and must be updated continuously. Each significant implementation step must be logged with evidence.

## Log Format
Each entry includes:
- **Timestamp**: ISO 8601 format
- **Epic**: Epic ID
- **Story**: Story ID
- **Task**: Task ID (if applicable)
- **Action**: What was done
- **Files Changed**: Paths of files created/modified/deleted
- **Tests Added/Updated**: Test files changed
- **Result/Status**: Outcome (success, failure, blocked)
- **Blockers/Issues**: Any problems encountered
- **Baseline Impact**: Whether frozen baseline was affected (YES/NO, explain if YES)
- **Next Action**: What should happen next

## 2026-04-19 14:30 UTC - Implementation Tracking System Initialization

**Epic:** N/A
**Story:** N/A
**Task:** N/A
**Action:** Created implementation tracking system (IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-V1.md, IMPLEMENTATION-LOG.md, stories/README.md, updated CLAUDE.md with mandatory tracking requirements)

**Files Changed:**
- `/docs/architecture/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-V1.md` (created)
- `/docs/architecture/IMPLEMENTATION-LOG.md` (created)
- `/stories/README.md` (created)
- `CLAUDE.md` (updated - added implementation tracking requirements section)

**Tests Added/Updated:** None

**Result/Status:** Success - implementation tracking system operational

**Blockers/Issues:** None

**Baseline Impact:** NO (tracking system only, no architecture changes)

**Next Action:** Decompose STORY-001 into tasks

## 2026-04-19 20:34 UTC - STORY-001 Complete: GitHub Repository Setup

**Epic:** EPIC-001
**Story:** STORY-001
**Task:** TASK-001-001 through TASK-001-005
**Action:** Completed GitHub repository setup with version control foundation. All 5 tasks executed successfully:
- TASK-001-001: Created GitHub repository (cflorin/3aa) and verified SSH access
- TASK-001-002: Created initial repository files (.gitignore, README.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- TASK-001-003: Configured branch protection on main branch (require PR + 1 approval)
- TASK-001-004: Documented semantic versioning strategy in README.md
- TASK-001-005: Verified repository setup and branch protection

**Files Changed:**
- `.gitignore` (created) - Node.js, TypeScript, Next.js, Prisma patterns
- `README.md` (created) - Project overview, versioning documentation, architecture reference
- `CHANGELOG.md` (created) - Keep a Changelog format template
- Git repository initialized with initial commit df2978f

**Tests Added/Updated:** None (infrastructure task)

**Result/Status:** Success - STORY-001 complete, all evidence requirements met

**Blockers/Issues:** None

**Baseline Impact:** NO (repository setup only, no architecture changes)

**Evidence:**
- Repository accessible at https://github.com/cflorin/3aa
- Branch protection enabled on main branch
- Initial commit pushed successfully
- SSH access verified and working
- Semantic versioning documented in README.md

**Next Action:** Begin STORY-002 task decomposition (Design and Document RFC-002 Database Schema)

## 2026-04-19 20:50 UTC - STORY-002 Complete: RFC-002 Database Schema Verified

**Epic:** EPIC-001
**Story:** STORY-002
**Task:** TASK-002-001 through TASK-002-006
**Action:** Completed verification and validation of RFC-002 database schema design. All 6 tasks executed successfully:
- TASK-002-001: Verified RFC-002 document exists with proper structure and ACCEPTED status
- TASK-002-002: Validated 19 tables defined (exceeds requirement of 17)
- TASK-002-003: Verified 15 JSONB fields documented with structure comments
- TASK-002-004: Validated entity relationship diagram exists, shows shared vs user-scoped entities
- TASK-002-005: Verified supporting documentation (indexing, retention, migration, performance)
- TASK-002-006: Updated implementation tracking

**Files Changed:**
- `stories/tasks/EPIC-001-platform-foundation/STORY-002-database-schema-rfc.md` (created) - Task decomposition document
- `docs/architecture/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-V1.md` (updated) - STORY-002 marked done, progress 2/9
- `docs/architecture/IMPLEMENTATION-LOG.md` (updated) - This entry

**Tests Added/Updated:** None (documentation verification task)

**Result/Status:** Success - STORY-002 complete, RFC-002 verified as complete

**Blockers/Issues:** None

**Baseline Impact:** NO (RFC-002 already existed from baseline freeze, verification only)

**Evidence:**
- RFC-002 exists at /docs/rfc/RFC-002-canonical-data-model-persistence.md (34KB, 1035 lines)
- 19 tables defined with complete SQL schemas
- All tables have PRIMARY KEY constraints
- 15 JSONB fields with structure documentation
- Entity relationship diagram included showing shared/user-scoped separation
- Indexing strategy, data retention, migration strategy all documented

**Next Action:** Decompose STORY-003 into tasks (Provision Core GCP Infrastructure)

**Log Started:** 2026-04-19
**Maintained By:** Claude during implementation
**Update Frequency:** After each meaningful implementation step (task completion, significant file changes, test additions, blockers encountered, baseline impacts)
